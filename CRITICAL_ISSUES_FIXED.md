# PromptShare Critical Issues - FIXED ‚úÖ

## Issues Resolved

### üîê Issue 1: File Upload Security Error - FIXED ‚úÖ

**Problem**: "File upload failed: Failed to upload CSK-PROMPT.jpg.webp: new row violates row-level security policy"

**Root Cause**: Missing Row Level Security (RLS) policies for Supabase storage buckets.

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Added Storage RLS Policies** to `project/supabase/policies.sql`:
   ```sql
   -- Media bucket policies (for posts, reels, etc.)
   CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view media files" ON storage.objects
       FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'media');

   CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload media files" ON storage.objects
       FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
           bucket_id = 'media' 
           AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
           AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
       );
   ```

2. **Applied Policies to Supabase**: Policies have been successfully applied to the production database.

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added user-friendly error messages in `Create.tsx` to help users understand upload issues.

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - File uploads now work correctly with proper security.

### üé¨ Issue 3: Vertical Reel Not Displaying - ENHANCED ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Uploaded vertical videos not appearing in the Reels section.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Videos were being stored as posts instead of reels
- Vertical video detection needed enhancement
- Database routing was not working correctly

**Solutions Applied**:

1. **Enhanced Video Detection** in `SmartFileUpload.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   const checkIfVideoIsVertical = (file: File): Promise<boolean> => {
     return new Promise((resolve) => {
       const video = document.createElement('video');
       video.onloadedmetadata = () => {
         const isVertical = video.videoHeight > video.videoWidth;
         console.log('üé¨ Video dimensions detected:', {
           fileName: file.name,
           width: video.videoWidth,
           height: video.videoHeight,
           isVertical,
           classification: isVertical ? 'REEL' : 'VIDEO'
         });
         resolve(isVertical);
       };
       video.src = URL.createObjectURL(file);
       video.load();
     });
   };
   ```

2. **Improved Create Page Logic**:
   - Clear visual indicators when reel is detected
   - Enhanced debugging information
   - Proper routing to reels table vs posts table

3. **Added Comprehensive Debugging**:
   - Console logs for video orientation detection
   - Visual feedback in the UI
   - Test page enhancements for troubleshooting

**Status**: ‚úÖ **ENHANCED** - Vertical video detection is now more robust with better debugging.
